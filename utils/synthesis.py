    Analysis for State X:
    - Crop production trend slope: {trend_x['slope']:.3f}
    - Correlation with rainfall: {trend_x['correlation']:.3f}

    Analysis for State Y:
    - Crop production trend slope: {trend_y['slope']:.3f}
    - Correlation with rainfall: {trend_y['correlation']:.3f}

    Crop production comparison:
    - Total production in State X: {sum(crop_data_x):,.0f}
    - Total production in State Y: {sum(crop_data_y):,.0f}

    Based on these metrics, policy recommendations would focus on water optimization where correlation is strong, 
    and expansion of drought-resistant crops where trend is declining.
